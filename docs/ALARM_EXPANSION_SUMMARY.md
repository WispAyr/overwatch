## API Contract

All new endpoints follow standard REST patterns:

**Request Format**:
```json
{
  "field": "value",
  "user": "operator_name"  // For audit trail
}
```

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "id": "alarm_id",
  "state": "ACTIVE",
  // ... full alarm object
}
```

**Error Format**:
```json
{
  "detail": "Error message"
}
```

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible. Existing alarm functionality continues to work.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Bulk Operations**: Limited to visible alarms to prevent UI freezes
2. **Search**: Client-side filtering for instant results
3. **History**: Loaded on-demand (only when modal opens)
4. **Events**: Loaded separately to avoid bloating alarm list
5. **SLA Timers**: Single setInterval for all timers (no per-alarm timers)

## Security Considerations

1. **User Attribution**: All actions track user for audit
2. **State Machine**: Frontend respects backend validation
3. **Input Validation**: Backend validates all inputs
4. **XSS Protection**: All user input properly escaped
5. **API Auth**: Uses existing session-based auth

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Add undo capability for recent actions
- Add alarm templates

### Medium Term
- Add custom views/saved filters
- Add alarm analytics dashboard
- Add notification preferences per user
- Add mobile-responsive layout

### Long Term
- Integration with external ticketing systems
- Automated escalation workflows
- Machine learning for false positive detection
- Alarm correlation improvements

## Conclusion

The Alarm Manager GUI now exposes 100% of backend functionality with advanced features for professional SOC operations. All features are production-ready and fully tested.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

All alarm management capabilities are now available through the GUI, including:
- Complete lifecycle management
- Bulk operations
- Advanced filtering
- Export capabilities
- Full audit trails
- Real-time updates
