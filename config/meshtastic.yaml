# Hardware Setup Notes:
# 1. Flash ESP32 with drone-mesh-mapper firmware:
#    https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/drone-mesh-mapper
# 
# 2. Connect ESP32 via USB or network
#
# 3. Find serial port:
#    - Linux: ls /dev/ttyUSB* or /dev/ttyACM*
#    - Mac: ls /dev/cu.usbserial* or /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART
#    - Windows: Device Manager â†’ Ports (COM & LPT)
#
# 4. Grant permissions (Linux):
#    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
#    (logout/login required)
#
# 5. Test connection:
#    screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
#    (Ctrl-A, K to exit)

# Antenna Placement Tips:
# - Place receivers at perimeter points for full coverage
# - Elevate antennas 3-5m above ground for better range
# - Avoid metal obstructions and electronic interference
# - Typical range: 500-1000m in urban, 2-5km in open areas
# - Use directional antennas for focused coverage zones
